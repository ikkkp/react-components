# React Practice Project

This project is designed as a hands-on practice for beginners to understand and learn the React component lifecycle and React Hooks. It provides a set of examples and exercises that demonstrate the usage and behavior of lifecycle methods in class components as well as Hooks in functional components.

## Project Objectives

- **Understand React Component Lifecycle**: Learn how class-based React components go through different lifecycle phases â€” Mounting, Updating, and Unmounting.
- **Explore React Hooks**: Get familiar with Hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`, `useReducer`, and more, which allow you to use state and other React features in functional components.
- **Hands-On Practice**: Implement small tasks and examples to solidify the understanding of React's core principles and functionalities.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Node.js installed on your system (preferably the latest LTS version).
- Basic understanding of JavaScript and ES6 features such as arrow functions, classes, destructuring, etc.
- Familiarity with concepts of React and web development.

## Installation

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps:

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ikkkp/react-components.git
   cd react-components
   ```

2. **Install NPM packages**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

To start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

This will run the app in the development mode. Open to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Features

- **Lifecycle Methods Example**: A class component that logs each lifecycle phase to the console.
- **Hooks Example**: Several components demonstrating different Hooks in action.
- **Context API Example**: A demo showing how to use `React.createContext` for managing state globally.
